      <h1 align="center">Welcome to My Minimalist Website</h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes, I find myself wondering... What would life have been like if I were born in the 1990s... A time when
        modern things were just beginning, everything felt pure, people were kind, and websites belonged to those who
        typed away on TTYs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, I decided to create my own personal 1990s-style website. I have started this journey multiple times, and
        now feels like the perfect moment to finally bring it to life.

          This is the first thing I must share. I can't express how important this journey is to me. I am still shaking
          as I write these words, even though it's been about a year. <em>The Camino de Santiago</em> or
          <em>Pilgrimage of Compostela</em>, a path that can begin from anywhere but has only one destination—<i
            >Santiago de Compostela</i
          >—is a network of pilgrim routes leading to the shrine of the apostle James in the cathedral of Santiago de
          Compostela in Galicia, located in northwestern Spain. Tradition holds that the remains of the apostle are
          buried there. Pilgrims follow these routes as a form of spiritual journey or retreat, aimed at fostering
          spiritual growth.<a class="fn" title="" href="#fn1">[1]</a> The journey covers about 930 km, taking the French
          Way as the example. I walked the final 200 km of it in June 2024, from the 6th to the 13th, and
          <i>The way of Finisterra and Muxía</i> from September 1st to September 13th, 2024.

          I was inspired to take this journey by the film <i>The Way</i>. I spent one week gathering what I needed and
          packed my bag as soon as I watched the movie, and then I was on my way. These two journeys have profoundly
          influenced how I view and treat the world, others, and "myself." I know that I will step on that land soon,
          someday. See my <a href="pages/articles/camino.html">journey</a>.

          I felt so frustrated that I couldn't switch from desk:C to desk:D in the <b><em>Windows</em></b> command line
          interface during a class in the 2020, I am a computer nerd at that time, so I decided that I must become a
          <b><em>Linux</em></b> command line master. The story begins on a normal night when I stayed up very late and
          figured out how to print "Hello, Yongteng" in the terminal using the magic shell command
          <code>echo "Hello, Yongteng"</code> in CentOS. After that, one of my pranking interests is "teasing Windows,
          and praising Linux -_^". I explored many Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, Manjaro, Arch
          Linux, and Debian. I found that <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and
          <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> are my cup of tea. During this process, I discovered something
          really fun: the Window Manager(WM), a program that controls and manages the position of your program windows
          in the window environment(WE). Here are my choices for window managers:
          <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3WM</a> (Linux) and
          <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">Yabai</a> (MacOS).

          What motivates me to keep living in Linux? <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim!</a> Neovim is a modern text
          editor built on top of Vim. While Vim has been around for over 20 years, it has accumulated a large, complex
          codebase of about 300,000 lines of C89 code, which makes it difficult to maintain and extend. Neovim was
          created to address these issues by improving Vim’s architecture and making it easier to add new features. One
          of the most significant improvements for quality of life is Neovim’s support for Lua. It allows users to write
          configurations and plugins in Lua, fostering a more collaborative environment and making Neovim an excellent
          choice for developers who want the power of Vim, enhanced with modern features like Lua for configuration and
          extension development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning Vim has been a part of my growth. There’s always something new and exciting to discover that enhances
          your efficiency and makes coding more enjoyable. I feel great when coding with Neovim, especially once I have
          gained enough control over a project. However, based on my experience, if you’re not familiar with a codebase,
          using Vim can sometimes make things more complicated. Here’s my little
          <a href="https://github.com/yongtenglei/Neovim-QWERTY">corner</a>, I hope you can find something useful.

          I've realized I don’t have the good taste in things, but luckily, I've got friends around me always point me
          to some awesome stuff, and I’m pretty good at listening to their recommendations. I think following a series
          can be time-consuming, so I rarely start one, but I really did some. Movie is one of the fantastic ways to
          experience a beautiful world or live through someone else’s extraordinary life in a short time, in just two
          hours. Here are some <a href="pages/articles/movie.html">movies</a> that I watched and can’t seem to forget
          for a long time.
