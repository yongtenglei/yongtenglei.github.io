      <h1>Welcome to My Minimalist Website</h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes, I find myself wondering... What would life have been like if I were born in the 1990s... A time when modern things were just beginning, everything felt pure, people were kind, and websites belonged to those who typed away on TTYs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, I decided to create my own personal 1990s-style website. I have started this journey multiple times, and now feels like the perfect moment to finally bring it to life.
