      <p>I began this journey with doubts, hoping to escape reality or to see if this Camino was truly as the world claimed. I found that it was not only full of beauty, but also filled with kind-hearted people who made the experience extraordinary. I arrived alone, but left with the stories and memories of many others.</p>
